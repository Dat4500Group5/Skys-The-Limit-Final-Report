            <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
                <p>This study investigates the role of aircraft age and usage in contributing to flight disruptions, particularly carrier delays and carrier cancellations, among domestic U.S. flights.  While weather and air traffic are external causes, mechanical issues, often linked to aging, are internal and potentially predictable. We hypothesize that aging aircraft, through accumulated wear and maintenance demands, are more prone to causing disruptions, and this relationship can be quantified through historical flight data. 
                    To evaluate this, we used “The Sky’s the Limit” dataset covering all U.S. domestic flights since 1995 and joined it with FAA aircraft registration data. We computed cumulative totals for each aircraft’s number of flights (FLIGHTS), distance traveled (DISTANCE), and total airtime (AIR_TIME) to create usage-based age proxies, along with manufacture-year-based AGE. These four variables were then analyzed through correlation and regression tests to predict three key outcomes: proportion of flights with any carrier delay, proportion of delays over 30 minutes, and proportion of flight cancellations. 
                    The analysis revealed that delays over 30 minutes followed an S-shaped relationship with AGE: as planes aged, delays increased sharply, plateaued, and then rose again after about 15 years. In contrast, cancellations exhibited an inverted-U pattern: they increased with age but then declined beyond a certain point, although this was partially influenced by fewer aircraft in older age bins, which reduced reliability in the trend's tail. 
                    These patterns suggest that maintenance is a major contributor to flight disruptions or lack thereof. Industry literature supports this, noting increased maintenance demands beginning at year 7, and mandatory FAA Aging Aircraft Inspections beginning at year 14. Planes operating reliably at very old ages tend to be corporate, multi-engine aircraft with superior maintenance regimes and set flight routes, reinforcing the role of targeted upkeep in mitigating disruptions.

            <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
                <p>Per the FAA, 2.9 million passengers are served on 45,000 flights across United States Domestic flights. 20-25% of these flights are predicted to be delayed, with a 1-2% cancellation rate. Several factors may account for delays, most notably weather, air traffic congestion and mechanical issues with the plane. While weather and air traffic congestion are not influenced by the status of a plane, mechanical problems may be explained through plane age, as wear from normal usage of the plane may incur increased amounts of maintenance. Thus, the purpose of this research project is to investigate the relationship between plane age and plane mishaps. Additionally, a multivariate model will assess plane age calculation.</p>
                <p>This project uses The Sky’s the Limit dataset which contains data for all domestic flights since 1987.</p>
                <p>FAA plane registration data has been joined via tail number association to calculate manufacture date for each aircraft.</p>
                <h3> The Data </h3>

            <h2 id="method">Methods</h2>
                <h3 id="data">Data Wrangling</h3>
                <p>Per the FAA, 2.9 million passengers are served on 45,000 flights across United States Domestic flights every day. 20-25% of these flights are predicted to be delayed, with a 1-2% cancellation rate. Several factors may account for delays, most notably weather, air traffic congestion, and mechanical issues with the plane. While weather and air traffic congestion are not influenced by the status of a plane, mechanical problems may be explained through plane age, as wear from normal usage of the plane may incur increased amounts of maintenance. Thus, the purpose of this research project is to investigate the relationship between plane age and plane mishaps.  </p>
                <p>Cleaning data was minimal, as The Sky’s the Limit data contained no missing values. However, as it provided a single flight per row, the dataset needed to be reorganized to be used as a tool to track the age of a plane. A plane’s tail number is a 5-character code, providing a unique identifier for an aircraft and it is provided as variable ‘Tail_Number’. This variable would be used to track the status of a single plane, allowing us to analyze the trends of planes over their lifetime. Joining data from a single tail number for each calendar year was in service, provided a reorganized dataset that displayed a unique year and tail number per row. This allowed us to greatly reduce the size of the datasets we were using.  Three variables were selected to be used as airplane age proxy measurements from this dataset. The variables of flights, distance and airtime were taken. Flights reported the total count of flights a plane over its commission. Distance reported the total distance in miles that the plane had flown. Airtime reported the total time spent in minutes that a plane was in the air. By joining all flights within the same year for each tail number, the variables of interest (flights, distance & airtime) were summed into yearly totals. These variables represented usage of the airplanes, but did not represent the actual age of the planes. Therefore, aircraft registration data from the FAA website was left joined to this dataset to provide the manufacture year of the aircraft, allowing the variable ‘AGE’ to be calculated as the current year minus manufacture year. Finally, the mishap measuring variables were added into the data, using the previous method of joining per year for each tail number. Valid measurements of flight mishaps use include ‘Carrier_Cancellation’ and ‘Carrier_Delay’. </p>

                <h3 id="parquet">Parquet Files Use</h2>
                <p> We used Parquet files to efficiently download entire years of flight data at once directly off of the Skys the Limit website, rather than retrieving each month individually. By using the select function, we were able to extract only the variables relevant to our analysis, improving both speed and memory usage.  </p>

                <h3 id="proportion">Adding Proportions</h2>
                <p>Proportions were calculated for planes out of total flights that were delayed more than thirty minutes, and this ratio was added to the dataset as a new variable. This proportion would be used to show the proportion of flights that were delayed per year per tail number. Thirty minutes was used as the cutoff for significant delays and thus was used in the delay ratio. Also, a ratio for cancellations was created to display the proportion of flights cancelled per year per tail number. This proportion used carrier cancellations divided by flights for a plane. </p>

                <h3 id="age">Four Ages</h2>
                <p>Correlation tests were done with the 4 ways to look at age (years since manufacture, total flights & annual flights, total airtime, and total distance travelled) and the ratios of planes delayed by more than 30 minutes. A multivariable regression model was created with all four ages, with the ratio of planes delayed more than 30 minutes as the dependent variable. Another multivariable regression model was created with all four ages, with the ratio of flights that were cancelled as the dependent variable. </p>
                <h3 id="multi">Multicollinearity</h2>
                <p>A correlation test was done between annual flights and age in years since manufacture.</p>
                <p>Multicollinearity was a concern for the tests being done with four (or five) ways to look at age in the model looking at delays. The Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) needed to be calculated to determine if any of our ages are collinear (distance and airtime have similar scatterplots). We were looking for a VIF over 5 to be too high. The VIF for both Distance and Air Time was astronomical. The two variables were very highly correlated and could skew results of the model. They were combined into one variable for the model, and then the multicollinearity was tested again.</p>
                <p>The multivariable regression model with the proportion of flights that were cancelled as the dependent variable was created with Distance and Air time combined, and then that model was also tested for collinearity.</p>

                <h3 id="cor">Correlation Tests</h3>
                <p>Correlation tests were done with the 4 ways to look at age (years since manufacture, total flights, total airtime, and total distance travelled) and the proportions of planes delayed by more than 30 minutes, and it was determined that MFR age (years since manufacture) was the age variable with the most statistically significant effect on the response variable, because it had a very small p value. The r/correlation value is 0.28 (strong values are near 1.0). The effect that this age value had on the delays was moderate. </p>
                <p>In looking at the effects of the different ages on delays of more than 30 minutes, there was a statistical outlier in the Hawaiian Airlines aircraft because their planes flew many more total flights than any other aircraft.</p>

                <h4>AGE</h4>
                    <p>A model was fit for using AGE (years since manufacture) as a predictor variable for the proportion of planes that were delayed by more than 30 minutes.</p>
                    <p>The instances of aircraft were groupled by age, then plotted by mean delay time and a cubic model was fitted. There was a clear relationship between AGE and aircraft delays.</p>
                <h4>FLIGHTS</h4>
                    <p>A model was fit using FLIGHTS as a predictor variable for the proportion of planes delayed by more than 30 minutes. The instances of aircraft were binned by 1000 planes and then a cubic model was fit on the data.</p>
                    <p>There were a number of outliers, representing aircraft flying between islands in Hawaii, that scewed the regression line. Removing those outliers from the regression line fit more accurately.</p>
