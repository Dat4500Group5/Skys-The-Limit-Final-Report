        <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
        <p>This study investigates the role of aircraft age and usage in contributing to flight disruptions, particularly carrier delays and carrier cancellations, among domestic U.S. flights.  While weather and air traffic are external causes, mechanical issues, often linked to aging, are internal and potentially predictable. We hypothesize that aging aircraft, through accumulated wear and maintenance demands, are more prone to causing disruptions, and this relationship can be quantified through historical flight data. 
            To evaluate this, we used “The Sky’s the Limit” dataset covering all U.S. domestic flights since 1995 and joined it with FAA aircraft registration data. We computed cumulative totals for each aircraft’s number of flights (FLIGHTS), distance traveled (DISTANCE), and total airtime (AIR_TIME) to create usage-based age proxies, along with manufacture-year-based AGE. These four variables were then analyzed through correlation and regression tests to predict three key outcomes: proportion of flights with any carrier delay, proportion of delays over 30 minutes, and proportion of flight cancellations. 
            The analysis revealed that delays over 30 minutes followed an S-shaped relationship with AGE: as planes aged, delays increased sharply, plateaued, and then rose again after about 15 years. In contrast, cancellations exhibited an inverted-U pattern: they increased with age but then declined beyond a certain point, although this was partially influenced by fewer aircraft in older age bins, which reduced reliability in the trend's tail. 
            These patterns suggest that maintenance is a major contributor to flight disruptions or lack thereof. Industry literature supports this, noting increased maintenance demands beginning at year 7, and mandatory FAA Aging Aircraft Inspections beginning at year 14. Planes operating reliably at very old ages tend to be corporate, multi-engine aircraft with superior maintenance regimes and set flight routes, reinforcing the role of targeted upkeep in mitigating disruptions.

        <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
            <p>Per the FAA, 2.9 million passengers are served on 45,000 flights across United States Domestic flights. 20-25% of these flights are predicted to be delayed, with a 1-2% cancellation rate. Several factors may account for delays, most notably weather, air traffic congestion and mechanical issues with the plane. While weather and air traffic congestion are not influenced by the status of a plane, mechanical problems may be explained through plane age, as wear from normal usage of the plane may incur increased amounts of maintenance. Thus, the purpose of this research project is to investigate the relationship between plane age and plane mishaps. Additionally, a multivariate model will assess plane age calculation.</p>

        <p>TODO</p>

        <h3 id="parquet">Parquet Files Use</h3>
        <p>We used Parquet files to efficiently download entire years of flight data at once directly off of the Skys the Limit website, rather than retrieving each month individually. By using the select function, we were able to extract only the variables relevant to our analysis, improving both speed and memory usage. </p>

        <h3 id="data">Data Wrangling</h3>
        <p>Per the FAA, 2.9 million passengers are served on 45,000 flights across United States Domestic flights every day. 20-25% of these flights are predicted to be delayed, with a 1-2% cancellation rate. Several factors may account for delays, most notably weather, air traffic congestion, and mechanical issues with the plane. While weather and air traffic congestion are not influenced by the status of a plane, mechanical problems may be explained through plane age, as wear from normal usage of the plane may incur increased amounts of maintenance. Thus, the purpose of this research project is to investigate the relationship between plane age and plane mishaps.  </p>
        <p>Cleaning data was minimal, as The Sky’s the Limit data contained no missing values. However, as it provided a single flight per row, the dataset needed to be reorganized to be used as a tool to track the age of a plane. A plane’s tail number is a 5-character code, providing a unique identifier for an aircraft and it is provided as variable ‘Tail_Number’. This variable would be used to track the status of a single plane, allowing us to analyze the trends of planes over their lifetime. Joining data from a single tail number for each calendar year was in service, provided a reorganized dataset that displayed a unique year and tail number per row. This allowed us to greatly reduce the size of the datasets we were using.  Three variables were selected to be used as airplane age proxy measurements from this dataset. The variables of flights, distance and airtime were taken. Flights reported the total count of flights a plane over its commission. Distance reported the total distance in miles that the plane had flown. Airtime reported the total time spent in minutes that a plane was in the air. By joining all flights within the same year for each tail number, the variables of interest (flights, distance & airtime) were summed into yearly totals. These variables represented usage of the airplanes, but did not represent the actual age of the planes. Therefore, aircraft registration data from the FAA website was left joined to this dataset to provide the manufacture year of the aircraft, allowing the variable ‘AGE’ to be calculated as the current year minus manufacture year. Finally, the mishap measuring variables were added into the data, using the previous method of joining per year for each tail number. Valid measurements of flight mishaps use include ‘Carrier_Cancellation’ and ‘Carrier_Delay’. </p>

        <h3 id="proportion">Adding Proportions</h3>
        <p>PProportions were calculated for planes out of total flights that were delayed more than thirty minutes, and this ratio was added to the dataset as a new variable. This proportion would be used to show the proportion of flights that were delayed per year per tail number. Thirty minutes was used as the cutoff for significant delays and thus was used in the delay ratio. Also, a ratio for cancellations was created to display the proportion of flights cancelled per year per tail number. This proportion used carrier cancellations divided by flights for a plane. </p>

        <h3 id="age">Four Ages</h3>
        <p>Correlation tests were done with the 4 ways to look at age (years since manufacture, total flights & annual flights, total airtime, and total distance travelled) and the ratios of planes delayed by more than 30 minutes. A multivariable regression model was created with all four ages, with the ratio of planes delayed more than 30 minutes as the dependent variable. Another multivariable regression model was created with all four ages, with the ratio of flights that were cancelled as the dependent variable.</p>

        <h3 id="multi">Multicollinearity</h3>
        <p>A correlation test was done between annual flights and age in years since manufacture. 

            Multicollinearity was a concern for the tests being done with four (or five) ways to look at age in the model looking at delays. The Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) needed to be calculated to determine if any of our ages are collinear (distance and airtime have similar scatterplots). We were looking for a VIF over 5 to be too high. The VIF for both Distance and Air Time was astronomical. The two variables were very highly correlated and could skew results of the model. They were combined into one variable for the model, and then the multicollinearity was tested again. 
            
            The multivariable regression model with the proportion of flights that were cancelled as the dependent variable was created with Distance and Air time combined, and then that model was also tested for collinearity.</p>

        <h3 id="hi">Hawaiian Aircraft Outliers</h3>
        <p>As mentioned previously, several visualizations revealed a couple of outlier planes that had much greater flight counts than other airplanes. Further investigation revealed that all of these outliers were planes that flew within the Hawaiian Islands. These numerous short flights allowed them to keep other variables at a normal level, while accumulating many more flights than planes on other routes. Since these airplanes had such different usage trends from the rest of the data, we decided to remove them because we assumed they would skew our data. </p>

        <h3 id="reg">Multivariable Regression</h3>
        <p>Multivariable regression was conducted with the four age variables together (looking at flights both annually and cumulatively). The results for summary of the model with the proportion of flights that were delayed more than 30 minutes were as follows:  </p>
        <p>The four age variables were confirmed to be statistically significant because they all have very small p values. The estimate values represent the multivariable regression model’s prediction for how much the proportion of flights being delayed more than 30 minutes will increase by each 1-unit increase in age.  
            <u1>
                <l1>For each one-year increase in age, the proportion of planes delayed more than 30 minutes should increase by 0.146. </l1>
                <l2>For each one-mile increase in distance, the proportion of planes delayed more than 30 minutes should decrease by 0.00003. </l2>
                <l3> For each one-flight increase in annual flights, the proportion of planes delayed more than 30 minutes should decrease by -0.0012. </l3>
                <l4> For each one-flight increase in total flights, the proportion of planes delayed more than 30 minutes should increase by .0001061. </l4>
                <l5>For each one-hour increase in airtime, the proportion of planes delayed more than 30 minutes should increase by 0.000001783.</l5>
